## Dialog
Dusty Giftwrap:
```
> Hi there! I'm Dusty Giftwrap, back from the battlefield! I'm mostly here for the snowball fights!
> But I also don't want Santa angry at us, you wouldn't like him when he's angry. His face becomes as red as his hat! So I guess I'm rooting for Alabaster.
> Alabaster Snowball seems to be having quite a pickle with Wombley Cube. We need your wizardry.
> Take down Wombley the usual way with a friend, or try a different strategy by tweaking client-side values for an extra edge.
> Alternatively, we've got a secret weapon - a giant snow bomb - but we can't remember where we put it or how to launch it.
> Adjust the right elements and victory for Alabaster can be secured with more subtlety. Intriguing, right?
> Raring to go? Terrific! Here's a real brain tickler. Navigator of chaos or maestro of subtlety, which will you be? Either way, remember our objective: bring victory to Alabaster.
> Confidence! Wit! We've got what it takes. Team up with a friend or find a way to go solo - no matter how, let's end this conflict and take down Wombley!
