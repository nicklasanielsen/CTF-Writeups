## Dialog
Eve Snowshoes:
```
> Hi there, tech saviour! Eve Snowshoes and Team Alabaster in need of assistance.
> I've been busy creating and testing a modern solution to Santa’s Naughty-Nice List, and I even built an Android app to streamline things for Alabaster’s team.
> But here’s my tiny reindeer-sized problem: I made a debug version and a release version of the app.
> I accidentally left out a child's name on each version, but for the life of me, I can't remember who!
> Could you start with the debug version first, figure out which child’s name isn’t shown in the list within the app, then we can move on to release? I’d be eternally grateful!
