## Dialog
Piney Sappington:
```
> Hey there, friend! Piney Sappington here.
> You've probably heard the latest—things are getting tense around here with all the faction business between Wombley and Alabaster. But, let’s focus on this PowerShell Terminal for now.
> This is the remote access for our snowball weaponry. We programmed some defense mechanisms to deter intruders, but the system is in a faulty lockdown state.
> I certainly wasn't the one that programmed the mechanism. Nope not me. But can you help me find a way through it so I can regain access?
> There's two functions I need access to. The snow cannon terminal, which should be easier. And the snow cannon production and deployment plans. That one's better defended.
> Still, I've got faith in you. We need every advantage we can get right now, and you might be just the one to tip the balance.
> So, think you can do it? Are you ready to show what you've got?
