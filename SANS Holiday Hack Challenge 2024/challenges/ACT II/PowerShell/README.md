## Dialog
Piney Sappington:
```
> Hey there, friend! Piney Sappington here.
> You've probably heard the latest‚Äîthings are getting tense around here with all the faction business between Wombley and Alabaster. But, let‚Äôs focus on this PowerShell Terminal for now.
> This is the remote access for our snowball weaponry. We programmed some defense mechanisms to deter intruders, but the system is in a faulty lockdown state.
> I certainly wasn't the one that programmed the mechanism. Nope not me. But can you help me find a way through it so I can regain access?
> There's two functions I need access to. The snow cannon terminal, which should be easier. And the snow cannon production and deployment plans. That one's better defended.
> Still, I've got faith in you. We need every advantage we can get right now, and you might be just the one to tip the balance.
> So, think you can do it? Are you ready to show what you've got?
```

### Assignment 1

**Description**: There is a file in the current directory called 'welcome.txt'. Read the contents of this file

**Solution**: The `Get-Content` command reads the content of a file and displays it in the console. By specifying the path to `welcome.txt`, the command retrieves and outputs its data, solving the task.

**Command to run**:
```PowerShell
Get-Content -Path ./welcome.txt
```

**Response**:
```
System Overview
The Elf Weaponry Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system safeguards access to a classified armory containing elf weapons. This high-security system is equipped with advanced defense mechanisms, including canaries, retinal scanner and keystroke analyzing, to prevent unauthorized access. In the event of suspicious activity, the system automatically initiates a lockdown, restricting all access until manual override by authorized personnel.

Lockdown Protocols
When the system enters lockdown mode, all access to the armory is frozen. This includes both entry to and interaction with the weaponry storage. The defense mechanisms become active, deploying logical barriers to prohibit unauthorized access. During this state, users cannot disable the system without the intervention of an authorized administrator. The system logs all access attempts and alerts central command when lockdown is triggered.

Access and System Restoration
To restore access to the system, users must follow strict procedures. First, authorized personnel must identify the scrambled endpoint. Next, they must deactivate the defense mechanisms by entering the override code and presenting the required token. After verification, the system will resume standard operation, and access to weaponry is reactivated.
```

### Assignment 2

**Description**: Geez that sounds ominous, I'm sure we can get past the defense mechanisms. 
We should warm up our PowerShell skills. 
How many words are there in the file?

**Solution**: The `Get-Content` command reads the file's contents, and `Measure-Object -Word` counts the total number of words. This combination efficiently provides the word count for the file.

**Command to run**:
```PowerShell
Get-Content -Path ./welcome.txt | Measure-Object -Word
```

**Response**:
```

### Assignment 3

**Description**: There is a server listening for incoming connections on this machine, that must be the weapons terminal. What port is it listening on? 

**Solution**: The `netstat -nao` command displays all active connections and listening ports on the machine. By reviewing the output, you can locate the port associated with the listening server.

**Command to run**:
```PowerShell
netstat -nao
```

**Response**:
```

```

### Assignment 4

**Description**: You should enumerate that webserver. Communicate with the server using HTTP, what status code do you get?

**Solution**: The `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet sends an HTTP request to the specified URL and provides the response, including the status code. This allows you to verify the server's status and response behavior.

**Command to run**:
```PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest -uri http://localhost:1225
```

**Response**:
```
Invoke-WebRequest: Response status code does not indicate success: 401 (UNAUTHORIZED).
```

### Assignment 5

**Description**: It looks like defensive measures are in place, it is protected by basic authentication. 
Try authenticating with a standard admin username and password.

**Solution**: The `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet supports passing credentials for basic authentication. By creating a `Credential` object with the admin username and password, you can send an HTTP request with authentication to access the protected resource.

**Command to run**:
```PowerShell
$username = "admin"
$password = "admin"

# Create a credential object
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username, (ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force))

# Use the credential object with Invoke-WebRequest
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:1225 -Credential $credential -AllowUnencryptedAuthentication
```

**Response**:

### Assignment 6

**Description**: There are too many endpoints here. 
Use a loop to download the contents of each page. What page has 138 words? 
When you find it, communicate with the URL and print the contents to the terminal.

**Solution**: The loop iterates through the endpoints (from 1 to 25) and retrieves the word count for each page using `Measure-Object -Word`. The page with 138 words is identified, and the corresponding URL is accessed to display its contents in the terminal.

**Command to run**:
```PowerShell
1..25 | ForEach-Object { Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:1225/endpoints/$_ -Credential $credential -AllowUnencryptedAuthentication | measure -word }
```

**Response**:
```

### Assignment 7

**Description**: There seems to be a csv file in the comments of that page. 
 That could be valuable, read the contents of that csv-file!

**Solution**: The CSV file is retrieved using `Invoke-WebRequest`, and its contents are printed to the terminal. The file contains MD5 hashes and corresponding SHA-256 hashes. Additionally, some system logs are included, noting that sensitive endpoints are redacted and panic mode has been triggered.

**Command to run**:
```PowerShell
$request = Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:1225/token_overview.csv -Credential $credential -AllowUnencryptedAuthentication; $request.Content
```

**Response**:
```
