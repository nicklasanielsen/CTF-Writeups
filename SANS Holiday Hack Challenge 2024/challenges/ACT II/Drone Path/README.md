## Dialog
Chimney Scissorsticks:
```
> Hey. Psst, over here. Hey, I'm Chimney Scissorsticks.
> I'm not liking all the tension brewing between the factions, so even though I agreed with how Wombley was handling things, I get the feeling this is going to end poorly for everyone. So I'm trying to get this data to Alabaster's side. Can you help?
> Wombley's planning something BIG in that toy factory. He's not really making toys in there. He's building an armada of drones!
> They're packed with valuable data from the elves working on the project. I think they hide the admin password in the drone flight logs. We need to crack this to prevent this escalating snowball showdown.
> You'll be working with KML files, tracking drone flight paths. Intriguing, right? We need every detail to prepare for what’s ahead!
> Use tools like Google Earth and some Python scripting to decode the hidden passwords and codewords locked in those files.
> Ready to give it a go? It’s going to be a wild ride, and your skills might just turn the tide of this conflict!
