## Dialog
Jingle Ringford:
```
> Welcome to the Geese Islands and the 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge!
> I'm Jingle Ringford, one of Santa's many elves.
> ...
> Just kidding! It's actually the 2024 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge!
> And although we're on Frosty's Beach on Christmas Island, we'll soon be on our way back to the North Pole.
> I thought it best to wait here for people that heard we're on the Geese Islands but may not know we're leaving.
> I haven't seen Santa since we started packing up, but he always asks me to give a quick orientation to newcomers, so I'm continuing the tradition.
> Before you head out any further onto the island, you need to accomplish two simple tasks.
```

## Solution: Silver
When we open the challenge, we are presented with a Linux terminal displaying the following welcome message:

```
Welcome to the first terminal challenge!

This one is intentionally simple. All we need you to do is:

- Click in the upper pane of this terminal
- Type answer and press Enter
```

To solve the challenge, we follow the instructions in the message by typing `answer` into the terminal and pressing Enter. After this, the challenge is registered as solved.
